# Shrinivas GitHubActions App

A minimal Node.js app that prints and serves the message:

"Shrinivas ,welcome to GitHubActions..!!"

## Run locally

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cd shrinivas-githubactions-app
npm start
```

- The message will print in the terminal.
- Open http://localhost:3000 in a browser to see the message served over HTTP.

No dependencies required; Node.js (v12+) is sufficient.
